# Plotlings

A collection of art generators that can export SVGs. I purchased an [AxiDraw V3] and it's been a lot of fun. Feel free to use these generators to make your own art.

## Running it yourself

Rust is required. To export to SVG, set the `SVG_EXPORT_DIRECTORY` environment variable. The programs support `.env` files.

## Generators

### Striped Columns

The first one I created for this project. It generates columns of lines that look neat.
